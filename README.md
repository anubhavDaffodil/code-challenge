## Assumptions
* Challenge asks for a "mobile web app", but prefers a project made in ReactNative (which can only be a mobile app)
* Icons provided (via icomoon) cannot be directly used in a ReactNative app, so they have been converted to a suitable form
* Color scheme is provided via '.scss' file, which is not supported in React native. Therefore it is converted using React native's `StyleSheet` component
* 'assets/football-event-icons-sprite/selection.json' does not have all icons, and icons in 'assets/football-events-sprite.png' cannot be converted to SVG (poor image quality), therefore, some icons have been added manually
* Match details of only one match have been provided, therefore the app will only have a single route, containing match details of that particular match (although navigator is still provided to add additional routes in future)
* Image assets for teams and league have not been provided, so they have been added manually
* It is assumed that data provided via 'json/match_sample.json' should be received via an API call, therefore haven't been placed in '/app/config' or any other folder. For now, it is placed in '/app/lib' folder
* No sample event provided for second yellow card or red card. Assuming those events will have category as 'booking', and value as 'Red' and 'SecondYellow' respectively
* No sample event provided for own goal. Assuming that event will have category as 'goal', and value as 'OwnGoal'
* Substitution on/off have separate events, but only one usable SVG icon provided (including both green and red arrows). Therefore, the SVG has been broken into two parts
